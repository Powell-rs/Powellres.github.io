Hello and welcome to my website. I am currently a first year Masters student in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences at Georgetown University, studying data science and analytics. I was formerly a undergraduate at Swarthmore college studying political science and statistics.

I'm pursuing a career in the intersection of advanced data analytics and politics, bringing technical abilities to policy and progress. Outside of that career, I'm a avid knitter, reader, and movie buff. I'm a fairly advanced skier and certified karate instructor under Tang Soo Do (A korean martial art).
