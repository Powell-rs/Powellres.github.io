For this project I specifically found a subset of the data where US States were mentioned, created visualizations of this dataset, found the sentiment associated with each state, and created a machine learning model to predict the score of the post based on all the variables.\n\n\nNatural Language Processing (DSAN 5800) Final Project\nLink to Deliverable | Github | December 2024\nSummary: For this project we created a presentation and report (which is in the github) on the use of various retrieval augmented generation (RAG) methods which had the goal of finding cases relevant to a search. Large Language models normally have a problem with hallucinating results and RAG is a method to sidestep that issue.\n\n\nElection Night Dashboard\nLink to Deliverable | Github | November 2024\nSummary: A Dashboard made in R for the Mecklenburg County Democrats in Charlotte, NC. We were working with them in 2024 during the election and they wanted a way to review their results and compare them to the 2020 and 2022 election seasons. The Dashboard was made in R using Shiny and Plotly to make the interactive graphs.\n\n\nReturning Student Scholarship\nLink to Deliverable | Github | June 2024\nSummary: When entering the second year of my two year program they gave the students a chance to compete for a merit-based scholarship through projects we make and our contributions to the program. We submitted a project based on soil water retention data from a study on Natural Bridges National Park. I submitted my project and won the second highest prize for my work.\n\n\nNueral Networks (DSAN 6600) Final Project\nLink to Deliverable | Github | May 2024\n\n\nAnalytics for Statistical Learning (DSAN 5300) Final Project\nLink to Deliverable | Github | May 2024\n\n\nIntro to Statistics (DSAN 5100) Final Project\nLink to Deliverable | Github | December 2023\n\n\nDSAN 5000 Final\nLink to Deliverable | Github | December 2023\n\n\nPolitical Science Comprehensive\nLink to Deliverable | Github | Date\n\n\n\nPapers\n\nPrincipal Components of Happiness\nLink to the paper\nSummary: In this article oublished in Regional Science Policy and Practice we disscus a novel use of Principal Componenet Analysis to index wellbeing in Mexico in a method that contrasted the leading economic measures. This was a project started in a workshop in 2020 through the CIMAT summer system and involved a presentation in the 61st annual conference of the Western Regional Science Association.\n\n\n\nArticles\n\nThe Swarthmore Phoenix\nThis links to all of the articles I wrote for the Swarthmore Phoenix while I was a staff writiter there. I wrote for the Campus Journal, Opinions, and Arts section. The wriritng didn’t overlap as much with my academic interests but I was happy to contribute to the periodical periodically.\n\n\nLegacy Dilemma\nInterviewed by the New York Times for an article on Legacy in the context of the end of Affirmative Action.\n\n\nFive Global Health Priorities for the future President\nWhile Interning for the Friends of the Global Fight I helped write this article published by Ambassador Mark Lagon in the American Interest"

    "text": "Hello and welcome to my website. I am currently a second year Masters student in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences at Georgetown University, studying data science and analytics. I was formerly a undergraduate at Swarthmore college studying political science and statistics.\nI’m pursuing a career in the intersection of advanced data analytics and politics, bringing technical abilities to policy and progress. To this extent I have an ongoing relationship with Bluebonnet Data where volunteered as a data scientist and then was brought onto the team to help manage other volunteers during the 2024 election cycle. I am excited to continue working in the progressive tech space and hope to bring my experience with a variety of organizations forward.\nOutside of that career, I’m a avid knitter, reader, and movie buff. I’ve taken up writing in the new year and hope to continue with personal coding projects on the side mostly realted to knitting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPowell Posing for a GradGov Headshot\n\n\n Github\n Powell.Sheagren@gmail.com\n Linkedin"
